# E-commerce Back End Starter Code
This repo contains code for an ecommerce backend.

## Description

This ecommerce backend application allows you to perform CRUD functions for each of the main tables: Category, Product, and Tag. It's purpose is to showcase my current knowledge of javascript and highlight certain proficiencies such as:

- NODEjs
- Sequelize
- Models
- ORM
- CRUD operations

## Usage

Usage of this application assumes the following: that you have cloned the repo, have node, mysql installed.

Then, from the command line:

- 'npm i' to install depedencies
- run the schema.sql and seed the database using seeds.sql 
- 'node index.js' to run application

You will know that the application is running when you see the following message in the console: 'App listening on port 3001!'

To test routes, use your favorite API tester, e.g., Insomnia.
